This repository contains the codes necessary to produce an interactive shiny dash board that can be found at https://pharmacoecon.shinyapps.io/wearableDash/. The original purpose of the document was to serve as the analysis toolkit for analysing user behavior with regards to wearable sports technology (eg. fitbit) The dashboard entails:

1. Allowing user to input dataset (as csv) and provide summary statistics on key variables of interest.
2. Users can specify the structural equation/growth curve model (i.e. incorporation of structural and measurement models).
3. Graphical display of the SEM can also be extracted through the dashboard.
4. Diagnostic plots regarding the model specified also included.
